Fontname: Alloy of Law - Bold
Version: 001.000

Glyphs are Copyright (c) 2021 of Brandon Sanderson, Isaac Stewart, and Dragonsteel
Entertainment.

This font was created by 17thShard user TheKingofCrimsonesia. It is a fan-created version of
the Steel Alphabet script that appears in the Mistborn novels. The Steel Alphabet symbols
were created by Isaac Stewart. The SVGs used for the Latin letters were created by
Coppermind Wiki user Paleo. The SVGs for punctuation were created by TheKingOfCrimsonesia.
Neither the individual glyphs nor the font may be used for commercial purposes, as per
Brandon Sanderson's fanart guidelines.

This font contains two lookup tables:
liga - four subtables to:
            (1) - substitute the name of a metal or a direction for its corresponding symbol
		(must be spelled in allcaps: IRON, STEEL, TIN, PEWTER, ZINC, BRASS, COPPER,
BRONZE, CADMIUM, BENDALLOY, GOLD, ELECTRUM, CHROMIUM, NICROSIL, ALUMINUM, ALUMINIUM,
DURALUMIN, DURALUMINIUM, ATIUM, MALATIUM, LERASIUM, ETTMETAL, HARMONIUM, WEST, NORTHWEST,
NORTH, NORTHEAST, EAST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTH, SOUTHWEST)
            (2) - display any double letters as a single letter 
            (3) - display the numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 256, and 4096 as the
		corresponding symbol.
kern - pairwise class-based kerning values

The mapping of the Steel Alphabet symbols to Latin was decoded by 17thShard user Valkynphyre.
The 24 basic symbols were downloaded from the Coppermind wiki in SVG format - these SVGs
were created by user Paleo. In Ben McSweeney's Inquisitor artwork on page 264 of the
Mistborn Adventure Game, a period and a comma appear. These were recreated by me, and used
as inspiration for the rest of the punctuation included in this font. Additionally, the
Kredik Shaw symbol was recreated by me from its appearance in McSweeney's Inquisitor piece.
The kerning values in the font are designed to mimic those in that same artwork.

The standard Allomantic symbols are assigned to the standard Latin alphabet
(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz). Note that E and U were created by moving the dot present in I
and O, respectively, in accordance with statements from Isaac Stewart. Harmony's symbol is
assigned to & (based on its use in Badali Jewelry's customizable steel alphabet ring), the
Kredik Shaw symbol is assigned to #, and Copper (or D) is also assigned to $ (based on its
use in the mistborn coin kickstarter as the symbol for a copper clip). Two additional
letters are present in the Steel Alphabet that do not exist in the Latin alphabet: SH and CH.
SH has been assigned to the Unicode "Esh" U+0283, and CH to "Tesh" U+02A7, which are both
part of the International Phonetic Alphabet Unicode range. However, the symbol for SH is
also used to represent J, and the symbol for CH is also used to represent C. It is my
personal belief that J and C reflect their use in Alloy of Law (341 Post-Catacendre), while
SH and CH represent archaic uses from the Final Empire Era. As such, the letter sequences
"S H" and "C H" are not automatically substituted by these symbols in this font. Similarly,
the use of moved dots to distinguish E and U from I and O is a new innovation in use in
Alloy of Law.

If using MS Word, once you create a new document, type some text, and set the font to
"AlloyofLaw," you must also highlight the text, expand Word's "Font" section at the top (or
press Ctrl+D), and navigate to the "Advanced" tab. Here you must select the checkbox
"Kerning for fonts" under the "Character Spacing" section. Under the "OpenType Features"
section select "all" from the drop-down menu labeled "Ligatures," and select the checkbox
"Use Contextual Alternates." I wish Word didn't make this so convoluted.

If you use a different text editor, search for information on "enabling advanced typography
features" or "enabling ligatures and kerning" for your program of preference. My experience
is limited to Windows & Microsoft; sorry I can't be of more help :(

2021-3-22: Created with FontForge (http://fontforge.org)
Fontname: Alloy of Law
Version: 001.100

Glyphs are Copyright (c) 2021 of Brandon Sanderson, Isaac Stewart, and Dragonsteel
Entertainment.

This font was created by 17thShard user TheKingofCrimsonesia. It is a fan-created version of
the Steel Alphabet script that appears in the Wax and Wayne novels. The Steel Alphabet
symbols were created by Isaac Stewart. The SVGs used for the Latin letters were created by
Coppermind Wiki user Paleo. The SVGs for punctuation were created by TheKingOfCrimsonesia.
Neither the individual glyphs nor the font may be used for commercial purposes, as per
Brandon Sanderson's fanart guidelines.

This font contains two lookup tables:
liga - four subtables to:
            (1) - substitute the name of a metal or a direction for its corresponding symbol
		(must be spelled in allcaps: IRON, STEEL, TIN, PEWTER, ZINC, BRASS, COPPER,
BRONZE, CADMIUM, BENDALLOY, GOLD, ELECTRUM, CHROMIUM, NICROSIL, ALUMINUM, ALUMINIUM,
DURALUMIN, DURALUMINIUM, ATIUM, MALATIUM, LERASIUM, ETTMETAL, HARMONIUM, WEST, NORTHWEST,
NORTH, NORTHEAST, EAST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTH, SOUTHWEST)
            (2) - display any double letters as a single letter 
            (3) - display the numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 256, and 4096 as the
		corresponding symbol.
kern - pairwise class-based kerning values

The mapping of the Steel Alphabet symbols to Latin was decoded by 17thShard user Valkynphyre.
The 24 basic symbols were downloaded from the Coppermind wiki in SVG format - these SVGs
were created by user Paleo. I created the punctuation included in this font.

The standard Allomantic symbols are assigned to the standard Latin alphabet
(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz). Note that E and U were created by moving the dot present in I
and O, respectively, in accordance with statements from Isaac Stewart. Harmony's symbol is
assigned to & (based on its use in Badali Jewelry's customizable steel alphabet ring), and
an altered Copper (or D) is also assigned to $ (based on its use in the broadsheets from the
Wax and Wayne novels as the symbol for a copper clip). Two additional letters are present in
the Steel Alphabet that do not exist in the Latin alphabet: SH and CH. SH has been assigned
to the Unicode "Esh" U+0283, and CH to "Tesh" U+02A7, which are both part of the
International Phonetic Alphabet Unicode range. However, the symbol for SH is also used to
represent J, and the symbol for CH is also used to represent C. It is my personal belief that
J and C reflect their use in Alloy of Law (341 Post-Catacendre), while SH and CH represent
archaic uses from the Final Empire Era. As such, the letter sequences "S H" and "C H" are not
automatically substituted by these symbols in this font. Similarly, the use of moved dots to
distinguish E and U from I and O is a new innovation in use in Alloy of Law.

If using MS Word, once you create a new document, type some text, and set the font to
"AlloyofLaw," you must also highlight the text, expand Word's "Font" section at the top
(or press Ctrl+D), and navigate to the "Advanced" tab. Here you must select the checkbox
"Kerning for fonts" under the "Character Spacing" section. Under the "OpenType Features"
section select "all" from the drop-down menu labeled "Ligatures," and select the checkbox
"Use Contextual Alternates." I wish Word didn't make this so convoluted.

If you use a different text editor, search for information on "enabling advanced typography
features" or "enabling ligatures and kerning" for your program of preference. My experience
is limited to Windows & Microsoft; sorry I can't be of more help :(
